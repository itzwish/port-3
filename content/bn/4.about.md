A few words about me

#intro

I'm Revy (aka Nabil Ahmed). Full-stack developer. Frontend, backend—no gaps. I build fast, scalable systems with clean code and zero patience for bloated or lazy solutions.

I care about performance, real UX, and shipping products that hit hard.
If it's slow, messy, or overcomplicated, I don't ship it.
